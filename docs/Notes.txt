Some notes for the Sagan cavity documentation:

* Voltage is true voltage. That is, the energy change of a particle with charge q will be
voltage*q. For example, if q is negative, a positive voltage with a positive phase factor 
will result in an energy loss. This is different from Bmad where the energy change will
be voltage*q/q_ref where q_ref is the reference charge.

* The RF is applied over L_active. 

* The multipoles and solenoid are applied over the whole length of the element.

* If normalized multipoles/solenoid strength are used, the normalization for the multipoles 
uses the reference momentum at the downstream end 

* With standing wave cavities: 
The pondermotive kick is ignored with `L_active` zero (Otherwise the kick would be infinite).
A very small `L_active` will lead to unphysical results.
